# Building a compiler in Go programming language
## Intro into building compiler/interpreter:
Whether you are building an interpreter or a compiler most of the steps remain the same. The most common, basic steps are:
1. Lexical Analysis
2. Parsing
3. Semantic Analysis
4. Optimization
5. Code Generation

### 1. Lexical Analysis
Code - representation of commands for computers which is most suitable for human reading and writing.
First step of building a compiler - performing lexical analysis.
Lexical analysis - process of scanning and splitting the code into small independent pieces - tokens.
Each token is associated with a literal string (lexeme) that will be used in next steps.
Literals (e.g., strings, integers, float numbers), keywords, operators are the main goals to recognize
on this step.
